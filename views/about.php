        <h2>"How the app works":</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Task List Creation: You can easily create your own task list by specifying the description of each task. It can be any task you want to accomplish.</li>
        <li>Task Status Tracking: After creating a task, you can mark it as "completed" or "unfinished." This allows you to track which tasks have been completed and which ones still require attention.</li>
        <li>Task Viewing: You can easily view your tasks and delete them if needed.</li>
        <li>Pagination and Navigation: If you have a large number of tasks, the app provides pagination, allowing you to navigate between different pages of the task list. You can also quickly navigate to the home page or other sections using navigation links.</li>
        <li>Authentication and Registration: The app offers functionality for user authentication and registration. You can create your account or log into an existing account to save your tasks and access personal settings.</li>
    </ul>
